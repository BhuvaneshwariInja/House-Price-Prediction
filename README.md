# House-Price-Prediction

This project is a step by step process of building a price prediction system. Firstly, a model is being built by using sklearn and linear regression
I have started by taking a dataset from kaggle.com 
During model building, tasks such as  data cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimentionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation are being performed. 

## Technology and Tools 
Technology and tools used for this project are as follows:
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building 
5) Jupyter notebook as IDE

The model gave an accuracy of 96.2%
